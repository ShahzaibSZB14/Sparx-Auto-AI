# Sparx AI Tools

Sparx AI Tools is a Chrome extension that adds homework help tools to Sparx Reader and Sparx Science pages.

## Modules

### Reader tools
#### LLM: Whatever LLM you choose!
Reader mode adds quick clipboard helpers directly into the page UI:

- **Simple design**: Just hit copy and paste into whatever LLM you prefer
- **Book copy button**: copies the current reading text into a prepared prompt format
- **Question copy button**: copies the active question + options into a prepared prompt format

### Science tools
#### LLM: Gemini by google [(?)](#why-gemini)
Science mode provides a one-click workflow around question extraction and AI response handling:

- **Solve Science button** for one-click processing
- **Stable question extraction** from Sparx question parts and tables
- **Gemini tab orchestration** (find/open, pin, submit, wait for response)
- **Structured response parsing** with guarded start/end markers
- **Floating result panel** with formatted answers (`a)`, `b)`, etc.) and copy/close actions
- **Global menu entry**: `Sparx AI Tools` in the Sparx header menu
- **Settings modal** for timeouts/retries and capture behavior
- **Auto-recovery** on transient timeouts (refresh/retry path)

## Recommended LLMs

From current testing:

1. **[Gemini](https://gemini.google.com)**: highest consistency
2. **[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/?temporary-chat=true)**: works, but can be less consistent in most cases

If you test another model and want it listed here, open an [issue](https://github.com/JensTech/Sparx-AI-Tools/issues/new).

## Why gemini?
The extension may work with other AI models, but I have only tested it with gemini
I used gemini due to the high limits on images and calculations.
*If you test another model and it works well, open an [issue](https://github.com/JensTech/Sparx-AI-Tools/issues/new) and I'll add it as an official model.*
